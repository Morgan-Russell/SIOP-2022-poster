Based on a cost–benefits framework and the explicit consideration of heterogeneity across respondents, we consider the effects of key contact design features such as personalization, incentives, and the exact timing of survey contacts on web survey response rates. We also consider the benefits of a “dynamic strategy”, i.e., the approach to change features of survey contacts over the survey life cycle. We explore these effects experimentally using a career survey sent to over 24,000 junior scientists and engineers. The results show that personalization increases the odds of responding by as much as 48\%, while lottery incentives with a high payoff and a low chance of winning increase the odds of responding by 30\%. Furthermore, changing the wording of reminders over the survey life cycle increases the odds of a response by over 30\%, while changes in contact timing (day of the week or hour of the day) did not have significant benefits. Improvements in response rates did not come at the expense of lower data quality. Our results provide novel insights into web survey response behavior and suggest useful tools for innovation researchers seeking to increase survey participation.},

This allowed a fine-grained comparison of response rates across respondent groups. Other unique features of this study are the analysis of response enhancing techniques across respondent groups and response rate trends over time. In order to aid researchers in designing surveys, we provide expected response rate percentiles for different survey modalities. Design: We analyzed 2,037 surveys, covering 1,251,651 individual respondents, published in 12 journals in I/O Psychology, Management, and Marketing during the period 1995–2008. Expected response rate levels were summarized for different types of respondents and use of response enhancing techniques was coded for each study. Findings: First, differences in mean response rate were found across respondent types with the lowest response rates reported for executive respondents and the highest for non-working respondents and non-managerial employees. Second, moderator analyses suggested that the effectiveness of response enhancing techniques was dependent on type of respondents. Evidence for differential prediction across respondent type was found for incentives, salience, identification numbers, sponsorship, and administration mode. When controlling for increased use of response enhancing techniques, a small decline in response rates over time was found. Implications: Our findings suggest that existing guidelines for designing effective survey research may not always offer the most accurate information available. Survey researchers should be aware that they may obtain lower/ higher response rates depending on the respondent type surveyed and that some response enhancing techniques may be less/more effective in specific samples. Originality/value: This study, analyzing the largest set of published response rates to date, offers the first evidence for different response rates and differential functioning of response enhancing techniques across respondent types.

	abstract = {This study explored the perceptions of an employee’s manager as coach behaviour and the relationship to their perceived work engagement. The Measurement Model of Coaching Skills ({MMCS}) by Park and colleagues and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale ({UWES}) were used as the tools to measure this relationship. The {MMCS} was also validated further in this study as there is limited psychometric data on this tool in the literature unlike the {UWES}. A total of 195 {MBA} students with work experience responded to the survey out of a possible 493 students. The results demonstrate a positive significant relationship between the respondents’ perceptions of their manager’s coaching behaviour and their own perceived work engagement. The {MMCS} also demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties, however, sub-scales failed discriminant validity. Most likely this is due to the difficulty in separating out discrete functions of the coaching role. As a result the composite score for the {MMCS} is recommended. The results add to the literature noting the benefits managerial coaching can have on organizational performance measures. Further development of managers is needed to enable them to become effective coaches as demonstrated by the below average result. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

However, despite its popularity, the {UWES} is not free from controversy concerning its factorial validity. In this paper, 21 research studies on both {UWES}-9 and {UWES}-17 factorial validity within the confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) approach have been reviewed in order to answer the question as to which of the {UWES} factorial structures displays greater validity. The originally proposed threefactor structure of the {UWES} has been recognized as superior in 6 studies. In further 6 studies, the {UWES} structure with 1 general factor has been found to be superior. In 8 studies, the authors have concluded that the one- and three-factor structures could be considered equivalent. One study has failed to confirm either the one- or three-factor structure of the {UWES}. These ambiguous results from studies focusing on the {UWES} factorial validity are puzzling because they not only indicate a lack of validity for the {UWES} as a measurement tool but might also challenge the whole concept of work engagement as a three-factor structure of dedication, vigor and absorption.

Methods: A total of 702 women, originally recruited as a general population of 7–15- year-old girls in 1995 for a longitudinal study, completed the {UWES}-9. Exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) was performed on half the sample, and {CFA} on the other half. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that a one-factor structure best fit the data. {CFA} with three different models (one-factor, two-factor, and three-factor) was then conducted. Goodness-of-fit statistics showed poor fit for all three models, with {RMSEA} never going lower than 0.166. Conclusion: Despite indication from exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) that a one-factor structure seemed to fit the data, we were unable to find good model fit for a one-, two-, or three-factor model using {CFA}. As previous studies have also failed to reach conclusive results on the optimal factor structure for the {UWES}-9, further research is needed in order to disentangle the possible effects of gender, nationality and occupation on work engagement.

Paradigm” as a novel variant of  tripartite model of
attitudes. The Campbell Paradigm is based on a highly restricted measurement
model that speaks of a compensatory relation between a person’s latent
attitude and the costs that come with any specific behavior. It overcomes the
overarching weakness of the original tripartite model (i.e., its relative
irrelevance for actual behavior) and offers a parsimonious explanation for
behavior. Even though this seems attractive, we also discuss why the paradigm
has not gained momentum in the 50 years since it was originally proposed
by Donald T. Campbell. To demonstrate the paradigm’s suitability even
when implemented with an unrefined instrument in a domain where it has not been
used previously, we apply the paradigm to a classic data example from attitude
research from the 1984 {US} presidential election to account for the
electorate’s voting intentions and actual voting behaviors.},

In this work, authors generally have emphasized model fit, and their typical conclusion is that a bifactor model provides a superior fit relative to alternative subordinate models. Often unexplored, however, are important statistical indices that can substantially improve the psychometric analysis of a measure. We provide a review of the particularly valuable statistical indices one can derive from bifactor models. They include omega reliability coefficients, factor determinacy, construct reliability, explained common variance, and percentage of uncontaminated correlations. We describe how these indices can be calculated and used to inform: (a) the quality of unit-weighted total and subscale score composites, as well as factor score estimates, and (b) the specification and quality of a measurement model in structural equation modeling.},

Third, we estimate a bifactor model in two vocational datasets to illustrate the concepts reviewed in this manuscript. The resulting models highlight novel insights in careers research (e.g., developmental performance feedback and personality [conscientiousness] modeling) that are made possible by leveraging bifactor measurement models.

The data were collected from employees (managerial/supervisory positions and non-supervisory positions) working for quick-service restaurants. Engagement, the emerging new concept, is perceived to be situated at the opposite end of the continuum of burnout, but the results of this study indicate they may be, rather, two distinctive concepts driven by different personality dimensions. The most critical personality trait affecting burnout is neuroticism and the most eminent traits predicting engagement are conscientiousness and neuroticism. This study does not validate the effects of positive personality traits such as extraversion and agreeableness on burnout and they are found to be weakly related to employees’ work engagement, as well.},

The increasing amount of research on concealable stigmas necessitates a cohesive model for integrating relevant findings.

Paradigm” as a novel variant of  tripartite model of
attitudes. The Campbell Paradigm is based on a highly restricted measurement
model that speaks of a compensatory relation between a person’s latent
attitude and the costs that come with any specific behavior. It overcomes the
overarching weakness of the original tripartite model (i.e., its relative
irrelevance for actual behavior) and offers a parsimonious explanation for
behavior. Even though this seems attractive, we also discuss why the paradigm
has not gained momentum in the 50 years since it was originally proposed
by Donald T. Campbell. To demonstrate the paradigm’s suitability even
when implemented with an unrefined instrument in a domain where it has not been
used previously, we apply the paradigm to a classic data example from attitude
research from the 1984 US presidential election to account for the
electorate’s voting intentions and actual voting behaviors.},

This article examines the mechanics of such schemes and, drawing upon United Kingdom evidence, the authors argue that employee participation in scheme design and implemenation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for scheme success. Strategic decisions must be made by management in four key scheme-organisation relationship areas, if productivity based schemes are to make an effective contribution to improved organisational performance. For management to make these decisions, extensive employee participation is required throughout the organisation and through all phases of the payment scheme. Productivity schemes introduced in haste with limited employee participation may at best achieve several short term goals, but the contribution such schemes can make to the strategic planning of the organisation will be lost.

	title = {The relation of work climate, higher order need satisfaction, need salience, and causality orientations to work engagement, psychological adjustment, and job satisfaction},
	abstract = {This study explored the contribution of various work climate and motivation variables to work engagement, psychological adjustment, and job satisfaction in a marketing research organization. It was hypothesized that work climate variables related to feedback, structure, and autonomy support, along with individuals' general causality orientations (i.e., predisposition toward interpreting environmental stimuli), would predict the extent to which they would perceive their higher order needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence as being satisfied at work. It was also predicted that intrinsic need salience would moderate the relationship between higher order need satisfaction and work engagement. Lastly, it was hypothesized that work engagement would mediate the relationship between (1) the interaction of higher order need salience and higher order need satisfaction, and (2) the outcomes of job satisfaction, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment. Subjects were 139 employees of one company in Western New York who were asked to report perceptions of their work context, along with both higher order need salience and higher order need satisfaction. Their general causality orientations, as well as work satisfaction and psychological adjustment were also assessed. Findings support the positive role of the work climate in predicting higher order need satisfaction, which in turn, predicted work engagement. Higher order need satisfaction also predicted job satisfaction, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment. The expected influence of causality orientations and need salience in this study was not found. Also, the mediational role of work engagement in the relationship between the satisfaction of higher order needs and the three outcome variables of job satisfaction, self-esteem, and psychological adjustment was not confirmed. Implications of these findings along with directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study expands upon existing knowledge of response rates by conducting a large-scale quantitative review of published response rates. This allowed a fine-grained comparison of response rates across respondent groups. Other unique features of this study are the analysis of response enhancing techniques across respondent groups and response rate trends over time. In order to aid researchers in designing surveys, we provide expected response rate percentiles for different survey modalities. Design: We analyzed 2,037 surveys, covering 1,251,651 individual respondents, published in 12 journals in I/O Psychology, Management, and Marketing during the period 1995–2008. Expected response rate levels were summarized for different types of respondents and use of response enhancing techniques was coded for each study. Findings: First, differences in mean response rate were found across respondent types with the lowest response rates reported for executive respondents and the highest for non-working respondents and non-managerial employees. Second, moderator analyses suggested that the effectiveness of response enhancing techniques was dependent on type of respondents. Evidence for differential prediction across respondent type was found for incentives, salience, identification numbers, sponsorship, and administration mode. When controlling for increased use of response enhancing techniques, a small decline in response rates over time was found. Implications: Our findings suggest that existing guidelines for designing effective survey research may not always offer the most accurate information available. Survey researchers should be aware that they may obtain lower/ higher response rates depending on the respondent type surveyed and that some response enhancing techniques may be less/more effective in specific samples. Originality/value: This study, analyzing the largest set of published response rates to date, offers the first evidence for different response rates and differential functioning of response enhancing techniques across respondent types.

The model proposes a structured framework for considering six areas of worklife – workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values – that have resonated through the literature on burnout over the previous two decades. The chapter presents extensive data on the {AWS}, testing a model of the six areas’ interrelationships as well as their overall relationship to the three aspects of burnout. The results of these analyses are discussed in reference to the psychometric qualities of the measure and the implications of a structured approach to work environments for future development of research on burnout.
