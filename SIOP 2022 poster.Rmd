# Introduction

In recent years, employee engagement has earned its stripes as a useful predictor of employee outcomes (e.g., Hanaysha, 2016; Alarcon & Edwards, 2011; Rich et al., 2010). Despite engagement's burgeoning popularity and emergence into the cultural mainstream, considerable disagreement exists among psychologists on the definition and factor structure of engagement.

The "substantive" model of engagement describes it as comprised of three dimensions: Vigor, or high levels of energy at work; Dedication, or feelings of involvement, pride, and meaning in one's work; and Absorption, or concentration and flow while working (Schaufeli et al., 2002). On the other hand, the now-resurgent tripartite model of attitudes (Rosenberg, 1960) divides attitudes into cognitive, affective, and behavioral components.

Rather than reject one model in favor of the other, we sought to develop an engagement measure which simultaneously captures *both*. 

# Methods

50 items were generated to semantically reflect one dimension each from the substantive and attitudinal models. For example, "I speak positively about this organization to others" indicates both the dedication and behavioral dimensions from the substantive and attitudinal models respectively. Graduate students and faculty sorted each item twice to their corresponding dimension within the substantive and attitudinal models. The 36 items that were most consistently sorted were retained for the study. 330 working adult participants were gathered via snowball sampling and responded to this set of items.

## Item Reduction

Our team used two parallel scale development methods: one focusing on corrected item-total correlations, the other focusing on CFA modification indices. In the former approach, the item with the lowest corrected item-total correlation was removed from the scale definition. This process was iterated after each item deletion until only two items per each of the nine pairs of substantive and attitudinal dimensions. 

In the CFA modification index approach, 

Items with high modification indices and

The two parallel item reduction approaches yielded two very similar, yet distinct, 18-item scale definitions. We merged these scales into a final 20-item scale definition based on wording preference and maximizing content domain coverage (see Table \@ref(tab:items)).

Using the `semplot` package,

```{r items, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
items <- read.csv("items.csv")

#get kable to shade every other row somehow

knitr::kable(
  items, format = "html",
  caption = "Final 20-item scale definition",
  align = "l",
  escape = FALSE,
  col.names = c("Substantive", "Attitudinal", "Corrected item-total correlation")) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped", "condensed"))
```


# Results


You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:items).

```{r data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Discussion
The present research makes at least three unique contributions. Firstly, it introduces a novel measure of engagement, developed in English and available for free.

Our engagement survey enables scientists and practitioners to simultaneously probe two separate dimensional structures of engagement.

Most importantly, we advance the use of bifactor analysis as
