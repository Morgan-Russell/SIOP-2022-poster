# Introduction

In recent years, employee engagement has earned its stripes as a useful predictor of employee outcomes (e.g., Hanaysha, 2016; Alarcon & Edwards, 2011; Rich et al., 2010). Despite engagement's burgeoning popularity and emergence into the cultural mainstream, considerable disagreement exists among psychologists on the definition and factor structure of the construct.

The "substantive" model of engagement describes it in terms of three dimensions: Vigor, or high levels of energy at work; Dedication, or feelings of involvement, pride, and meaning in one's work; and Absorption, or concentration and flow while working (Schaufeli et al., 2002). On the other hand, the now-resurgent tripartite model of attitudes (Rosenberg, 1960) divides attitudes into cognitive, affective, and behavioral components.

A traditional scale development approach would generate items which correspond to one 

We sought to develop an instrument which not only would assess both 

Rather than reject one model in favor of the other, we sought to develop an engagement measure in which each item simultaneously captures *both*. 

In so doing, we hope to effectively double the content domain coverage of our scale while minimizing 

# Methods

50 items were generated to semantically reflect one dimension each from the substantive and attitudinal models. For example, "I speak positively about this organization to others" indicates both the dedication and behavioral dimensions from the substantive and attitudinal models respectively. Graduate students and faculty sorted each item twice to their corresponding dimension within the substantive and attitudinal models. The 36 items that were most consistently sorted were retained for the study. 330 working adult participants were gathered via snowball sampling and responded to this set of items.

## Item Reduction

Our team used two parallel scale development methods: one focusing on corrected item-total correlations, the other focusing on CFA modification indices. In the former approach, the item with the lowest corrected item-total correlation was removed from the scale definition. This process was iterated     after each item deletion until only two items per each of the nine pairs of substantive and attitudinal dimensions remained. 

The CFA modification index approach focused on item retention rather than deletion. We ran two parallel CFAs, one on the substantive model and the other on the attituinal model. We prioritized the alternative model predicted model associations as items to retain.

The two parallel item reduction approaches yielded two very similar, yet distinct, 18-item scale definitions. We merged these scales into a final 20-item scale definition based on wording preference and maximizing content domain coverage.

Using the `semplot` package,

```{r items, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
items <- read.csv("items.csv")

#get kable to shade every other row somehow

knitr::kable(
  items, format = "html",
  caption = "Final 20-item scale definition",
  align = "l",
  escape = FALSE,
  col.names = c("Substantive", "Attitudinal", "Corrected item-total correlation")) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped", "condensed"))
```


# Results

Table \@ref(tab:items) shows the final set of 20 items.

# Discussion

The persent research introduces a novel measure of engagement, developed in English and available for free. By designing items to correspond to two separate factor structures, we effectively double our content domain coverage with the same number of items. Most novelly, we intentionally embrace complexity in scale development. We believe this approach has promising implications for developing constructs which reconcile, rather than reject, conflicting models of constructs. It it our hope that future researchers will weigh the benefits of broadening content domain coverage over the understandable desire for item parsimony.
